    <p>These are some selected movies that are great.</p>

    <h2> Man On Fire </h2>
    <p><i> Man on Fire</i> follows John Creasy, a burned-out former CIA operative who takes a job 
        as a bodyguard in Mexico City to protect Lupita “Pita” Ramos, the young daughter of a wealthy family. At first distant and cynical,
         Creasy gradually forms a deep bond with Pita, finding renewed purpose in her warmth and trust. When Pita is kidnapped during a violent 
        ambush that leaves Creasy seriously wounded, he becomes consumed by rage and guilt. After recovering, he embarks on a relentless, methodical quest to track down everyone involved in the abduction, 
        dismantling a web of corruption that reaches into law enforcement and organized crime. As the truth
         behind the kidnapping unfolds, Creasy pushes himself to the brink, ultimately seeking redemption through sacrifice while ensuring Pita’s fate is resolved.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Action-thriller</li>
      <li><strong>Why it’s interesting:</strong> The movie focuses on John Creasy’s internal struggle with guilt, redemption, and purpose, 
        which gives the movie more depth than a typical action film.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2> The Naked Gun </h2>
    <p><i> The Naked Gun</i> follows the son of the famously clueless detective Frank Drebin as he steps into his father’s shoes with the same
     overconfidence and complete lack of awareness. Tasked with stopping a major criminal plot that threatens public safety, he stumbles from one absurd situation to another, 
     misinterpreting clues, botching simple procedures, and accidentally causing chaos wherever he goes. Despite his incompetence, 
     his mistakes somehow bring him closer to solving the case, 
     leading to a chain of slapstick encounters, visual gags, and rapid-fire jokes.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Comedy</li>
      <li><strong>Why it’s interesting:</strong> The film leans heavily into parody, poking fun at modern action
         and crime thrillers while delivering the franchise’s signature blend of deadpan humor and outrageous misunderstandings.</li>
    </ul>

  <section> 
    <h2>Ponyo</h2>
    <p><i>Ponyo </i> tells the story of a curious goldfish princess named Ponyo who longs to become human after meeting a kind young boy named Sosuke living by the sea. 
        Fascinated by the human world Ponyo uses magic to transform herself into a girl but her actions disrupt the balance of nature causing the ocean to rise and threatening the safety of the coastal town. 
        As Sosuke promises to care for Ponyo no matter what form she takes the two children embark on a journey that tests their trust and bravery while Ponyo’s father and mother work to restore harmony between 
        the sea and land.</p>
        <ul>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy adventure</li>
      <li><strong>Why it’s interesting:</strong> it presents fantasy through a child’s perspective,
         where magic feels natural and closely connected to emotions rather than rules or logic. The story explores themes of love, responsibility, 
         and environmental balance without becoming overly complex</li>
    </ul>
